    title:
      "Low speed impact mechanics and Fragmentation of wooden panels : Characterization of Indian woods",
    description:
      "A comprehensive experimental, theoretical, and numerical investigation of the low-speed impact fragmentation of wood. Drop weight impact, quasi-static testing, modeling, and finite element simulation on thick rectangular wooden plates provide valuable insight into low-speed impact fragmentation. The material characterization by nondestructive testing helps understand the orthotropic and heterogenous nature of wood, which govern the fragmentation aspects.",

    title:
      "A novel approach towards the formulation and fabrication of ceramic hybrid composites using enhanced selective catalytic reduction (SCR) in de-nox applications",
    description:
      "Develop innovative ceramic hybrid composites engineered to serve as high-performance catalysts in selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems aimed at reducing nitrogen oxide (NOₓ) emissions.",

    title:
      "Examination of the implications of fibers’ alignment and volume fraction on the engineering constants of natural fiber epoxy lamina using analytical research.",
    description:
      "This project examines how variations in fiber alignment (e.g., unidirectional, cross-ply) and fiber volume fraction influence the engineering constants (e.g., Young’s modulus, shear modulus, Poisson’s ratio) of natural fiber epoxy laminates.",
